# LXK Proteus 77 SP2 ENG V10033: A Software for Electronic Circuit Design and Simulation
 
LXK Proteus 77 SP2 ENG V10033 is a file name that refers to a license key for Proteus, a design software developed by Labcenter Electronics for electronic circuit simulation, schematic capture and PCB design[^6^]. Proteus is a software suite that combines ease of use with a powerful feature set to enable the rapid design, test and layout of professional printed circuit boards[^4^]. Proteus also allows users to design, test and debug complete embedded systems inside schematic capture before ordering a physical prototype[^4^]. Proteus can also be used to create Arduino or Raspberry Pi appliances and control them remotely from a phone or browser[^4^].
